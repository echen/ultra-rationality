~dilemma
## The Prisoner's Dilemma

The prisoner's dilemma is a fascinating and well-known paradox in economics.
It illuminates the heart of fundamental problems with our current economic models.

In the dilemma, two prisoners, *A* and *B*, are charged with the same crime and
offered the same bargain.

From the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner's_dilemma):

- If *A* and *B* both betray the other, each of them serves 2 years in prison
- If *A* betrays *B* but *B* remains silent, *A* will be set free and *B* will serve 3 years in prison (and vice versa)
- If *A* and *B* both remain silent, both of them will only serve 1 year in prison (on the lesser charge)

- The [rational solution](##rational) is to always defect
- The [hyper-rational solution](##hyperrational) is to remain silent when playing
  with another hyper-rational player
- The [ultra-rational solution](##ultrarational) is to always remain silent

~rational
## Rational Solution

### Objective:
A *rational* player's objective is to minimize their time spent in prison.

### Theorem 1:
- The rational strategy is to always betray the other player.
- See [Proof of Theorem 1](##proof1)

### See also:

- The [hyper-rational solution](##hyperrational)
- The [ultra-rational solution](##ultrarational)

~proof1
## Proof of Theorem 1

* Assume you are player *A* and you want to minimize your time in prison
* If player *B* defects, your best strategy is to also defect (you therefore
  serve two years in prison instead of three)
* If player *B* remains silent, your best strategy is to defect (you therefore
  serve zero years in prison instead of one)

~hyperrational
## Hyper-rational Solution

### Objective:
The *hyper-rational* objective is identical to the [rational](##rational)
objective. That is, A *hyper-rational* player's objective is to minimize their
time spent in prison.

### Defintion of hyper rationality
A hyper-rational player is a player who has a perfect understanding of the game,
and uses a deterministic strategy.

### Theorem 2:
- When two hyper-rational players play together, they both remain silent.
- See [Proof of Theorem 2](##proof2)

### See also:

- The [ultra-rational solution](##ultrarational)

~proof2
### Proof of Theorem 2

* Assume:
    * You are player *A*,
    * You are hyper-rational, and
    * You want to minimize your time in prison
* Because you have a perfect understanding of the game, you will know if you are
  playing with another hyper-rational player.
* You are therefore assured that you will both use the same strategy (
  because you both have the same understanding of the game and and you both
  use a deterministic strategy)
* Thus, you will either *both defect*, or you will *both remain silent*
* Since, the silent strategy yields a superior payoff for youself you remain
  silent
* The other player follows the same strategy, you both remain silent, and you
  each receive one year in prison

~ultrarational
## Ultra-rational Solution

Here we introduce the concept of ultra-rationality and analyze its strategy.

### Axioms of Subjective Interpration
To employ an ultra rational strategy, we need to add two new axioms to our model:

1. Notions of penalty are inherently subjective.
2. Players have the power to choose their own personal interpretation of penalty.

We believe these axioms are realistic.

### Definition of ultra rationality

* An ultra-rational player is a type of [rational](##rational) player. Like a
rational agent, an ultra-rational agent is selfish.
* The distinguishing characteristic of ultra rationality is that an
  ultra-rational agent "cares" about all other agents equally.
  We call this attribute of ultra-rational agents "compassion."

### Objective:
As a straightforward consequence of the defintion of ultra-rationality,
ultra-rational players necessarily seek globally optimal solutions.

### Theorem 3:
- An ultra-rational player always produces a globally optimal solution.
- See [Proof of Theorem 3](##proof3)

~proof3
### Proof of Theorem 3

* Assume:
    * You are player *A*, and
    * You are ultra-rational
* By the Axioms of Subjective Interpration, you choose not to experience any
  penalty.
* Therefore to seek a globally optimal solution, you optimize your strategy for
  the other player's penalty
* If player *B* defects, your best strategy is to remain silent. In which case
    * Player *B* experiences zero years in prison
    * You experience three years in prison, but do not interpret it as a penalty
    * Thus the total global penalty is zero
* If player *B* remains silent, your best strategy is to remain silent. In which
  case:
    * Player *B* experiences one year in prison (which has a maximum subjective
      penalty of one year in prison)
    * You experience one year in prison, but do not interpret it as a penalty
* Thus the total maximum global penalty is one year in prison
    * This solution is optimal because player *B* makes the choice to experience
      as much or as little penalty as they desire.

~discussion
## Discussion

We believe that ultra-rationality represents a realistic and desirable
economics model. It seems obvious and self-evident that real humans have the
ability to choose their own personal interpretations of reality and have the
capacity to be compassionate. Compassionate and content prisoners exist.

Ultra-rational behavior depends on *contentedness*. If a player can experience
life joyfully and peacefully regardless of circumstance, then it can behave
selfishly while at the same time seeking globally optimal solutions.

Unfortunately, anecdotal evidence suggests that it takes great effort to
cultivate a subjective state of mind that is free from the experience of penalty.

~futurework
## Future work

We intend to pursue future work along a number of dimensions. We intend to:

1. Investigate [partial ultra-rationality](##partial)
2. Investigate ultra-rationality in [other contexts](##other-contexts)
3. Investigate [alternative formalizations](##alternatives)
3. Investigate ultra-rationality [experimentally](##experimentally)

~partial
## Partial ultra-rationality

Strict ultra-rationality seems to be both uncommon and difficult to achieve.

To address these problems we intend to investigate notions of *partial*
ultra-rationality. The basic idea is that we belive it is possible for
players to achieve incremental benefits from following weaker models of ultra
rationality. We hope to describe formal models of partial
ultra-rationality that are realistic and representative of real-world economics.

Towards this end, we intend to espouse the goal of partial ultra-rationality
in our work. We intend to study and practice partial ultra-rationality and we
invite all other scholars to collaborate on our research by studying and
practicing partial ultra-rationality with us.

We hypothesize that such an approach to research will yield superior research
products at lower cost.

~other-contexts
## Other contexts

In this work, we have only explored the effect of ultra-rationality on
the prisoner's dilemma.

We intend to explore the effects of ultra-rationality in other economic problems.

~alternatives
## Alternative formalizations

We defined ultra-rationality in terms of two Axioms of Subjective Interpreation
and a definition of ultra rationality. As we explore ultra rationality in
other contexts we may find it is beneficial to define ultra rationality
differently.


~experimentally
## Experimental reserarch

We are interested in finding test subjects who embody the characteristics of
ultra rationality and evaluate their actual performance in realistic games.
